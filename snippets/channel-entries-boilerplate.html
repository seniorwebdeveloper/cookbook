The search parameter allows you to constrain Channel Entries output based on content within your fields. You specify which field to search by using the fields short name immediately after search:. You can search based on whether a field is an exact match to your provided term or whether or not a field simply contains your term.

Note: Only fields of the type Text Input, Textarea and Drop-down Lists are searched with this parameter.
